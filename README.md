### ecen4003-project
**A multithreaded kernel-based image filter implementation**

----

This project is an implementation of an image filter implementation with the following characteristics:

- Multithreaded (worker threads processing tasks)
- Dynamic kernel size (different areas of the image can use different kernel sizes)

Tentative:

- Video filtering, three-dimensional kernels
- Pre-programmed parameterized kernels

##### Building & Running

`make build` builds the project without any fuss. `make run` will run the project on test data.
